# Fish-Prediction-App
Problem Statement: Build a ML model for the Fish market dataset - A Database of common fish species for fish market model. I have used the classification problem for this lab where based on the given feature values it will predict the fish species.
Different ML models are built to predict the species of fish out of which Logistic Regression gives the best accuracy.
Inside the data folder, you will get the jupiter notebook file that has all the EDA and model related analysis done.
I have then save the all the models and built a frontend to get all the predictions. used flask framework to create fronted and link it to the python file. app.py contains the source code to link with the index.html page and in this application I have also shown the dataset that I have used for this problem statement.
